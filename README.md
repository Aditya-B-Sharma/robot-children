# robot-children

An application to automate creation of children's picture books using ChatGPT and stable diffusion.
As we're capitalists, we then automate selling the book on Amazon or at least exporting a finished pdf.

***Basic testing***
<br>
<br>
To start the server locally:
<br>
<br>
Update the API key in ```TBD```, (get a key from OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/, you can use the free trial)
<br>
<br>
then run:
<br>
```python manage.py runserver```
<br>
<br>
then go to:
<br>
http://127.0.0.1:8000/robotchildren
<br>
and create an admin account. This creates an account on our firebase DB.
<br>
Log in and use the app.
